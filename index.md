Welcome to **HexWeb**, the website of Bryce Tsuyuki (a.k.a Hexalellogram)!
Under construction at the moment, come back later!

## My Projects
- [mac-setup](https://github.com/hexalellogram/mac-setup) - Setup script for macOS, to set up a Mac with my preferred tools
- [hexalellogram.github.io](https://github.com/hexalellogram/hexalellogram.github.io) - This website
- [ROM Documentation](https://github.com/hexalellogram/ROMDocumentation) - My log of steps taken on my Nexus 5 and OnePlus 3 with MultiROM
- [iPhoneBatteryClient](https://github.com/hexalellogram/iPhoneBatteryClient) - An Apple Watch app to synchronize battery status information between a paired iPhone and an Apple Watch. Very barebones and possibly non-functional.

## Contributing
If anything here is confusing (or _wrong_!), or if I've missed
important details, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/hexalellogram/hexalellogram.github.io/issues), or (even
better) fork [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/hexalellogram/hexalellogram.github.io),
make modifications, and submit a pull request.

## Attribution
Much thanks to the Jekyll and GitHub Pages documentation!
